# COVID-INFECTIONS EDA-
The year 2020 was tough considering the Pandemic.The future looked bleak due to lives being at risk.There was a lock down that extended to 2021.For this project I had a look at data published by the WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION  on all the civil deaths and civil vaccines for the dates indicated in the datasets.I tried to come up with an analysis to understand how the two situations were related and visualize my analysis using Tableau .It was reflecting how countries all over the world were affected and if vaccinations alleviated the tough situation.The link to my visualization is as follows:https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/joan2355/viz/covidedadashboard/Dashboard1?publish=yes
